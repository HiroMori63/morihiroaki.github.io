<h4>Childhood Health and Skill Formation: Task-based Evidence</h4>
<p class="text-muted">H. Mori</p>  
Existing evidence indicates that certain health conditions during childhood affect schooling outcomes. However, little is known as to  whether and how such influences persist into adult skills beyond academic skills. By adopting a multi-dimensional skills/tasks approach, this paper documents the link between childhood health conditions and skills used in the labour market.  To control for the influence of unobserved heterogeneity, this paper exploits the structure of sequential medical examinations conducted in the 1958 British National Child Development Study. The results point to the importance of childhood health conditions in determining the kinds of occupations in the labour market. In particular, I find that those who had mental disorders at age 16 tend to select into less cognitive skill demanding jobs while those who had physical disorders sort into less manual skill demanding jobs. The observed variation in job selection is found to be an important predictor of health-related earnings losses.</br>

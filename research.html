<h4>Estimating the Skill-Health Complementarities over the Life Cycle</h4>
<p class="text-muted">H. Mori</p>  
 A growing body of literature emphasizes the role of childhood health for shaping labour market outcomes. Little is yet known whether poor health during childhood influences later outcomes by restricting skill formation, or whether by mainly affecting future health. To address this issue, this paper formulates and estimates a model of the joint dynamics of skills and health over the life cycle. The estimated model is used to quantify the relative importance of the pathways through which childhood health conditions affect labour market outcomes. In the model, skills and health interact in producing future skills and health, with influences from endogenous decisions regarding schooling, occupations, labour supply and medical care use.  The estimates indicate that the most important channel accounting for health-related earnings gaps is the skill channel. The effects of childhood health status on individual tastes regarding occupation choice and  labour supply are also found to  play a significant role.</br>

<h4>Ageing and the Skill Portfolio: Evidence from Job-based Skill Measures</h4>
<p class="text-muted">A. Bowlus, H. Mori and C. Robinson</p>
The evolution of human capital over the life-cycle, especially during the accumulation phase,
has been extensively studied within an optimal human capital investment framework. Given the
ageing of the workforce, there is increasing interest in the human capital of older workers. The
most recent research on wage patterns and human capital in the accumulation phase has adopted a
new multidimensional skills/tasks approach. We argue that this approach is also well suited to the
investigation of the evolution of the human capital of older workers. There is clear evidence that
the typical concave Ben-Porath shape for a wage-based single dimension human capital measure
masks different shapes for the individual components in a multi-dimensional skill portfolio. Not all
components evolve in the same way over the life-cycle. Some components of the skill vector are
particularly sensitive to ageing effects for older workers, but this may be under-estimated without
individual level skill observations. Panel data suggest that workers do make differential adjustments
to the components of their skill portfolio as they age.</br>

<h4>Childhood Health and Skill Formation: Task-based Evidence</h4>
<p class="text-muted">H. Mori</p>  
Existing evidence indicates that certain health conditions during childhood affect schooling outcomes. However, little is known as to  whether and how such influences persist into adult skills beyond academic skills. By adopting a multi-dimensional skills/tasks approach, this paper documents the link between childhood health conditions and skills used in the labour market.  To control for the influence of unobserved heterogeneity, this paper exploits the structure of sequential medical examinations conducted in the 1958 British National Child Development Study. The results point to the importance of childhood health conditions in determining the kinds of occupations in the labour market. In particular, I find that those who had mental disorders at age 16 tend to select into less cognitive skill demanding jobs while those who had physical disorders sort into less manual skill demanding jobs. The observed variation in job selection is found to be an important predictor of health-related earnings losses.</br>

<h4>Specificity of Health Capital</h4>
<p class="text-muted">H. Mori</p>
How general is health capital? Estimates of health-related earnings losses commonly assume that skills are pre-determined and that health attributes are uniformly priced across occupations.  This paper departs from this convention and estimates how global health status  affects wages depending on worker skills and the nature of tasks performed by the workers. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Older Men (NLSM), this paper first documents that poor health status is concentrated among workers in strength-demanding occupations. This indicates that poor health status is strongly associated with the  heterogeneity regarding individual skills and the returns to skills across occupations. This paper further shows that the wage effects of general health differ  depending on how motor skills and strength-related skills are used in the occupations. The empirical results highlight the importance of accounting  skill-related heterogeneity to better understand the health-related wage differentials.</br>

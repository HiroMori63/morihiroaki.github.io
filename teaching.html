<p><font size="1">This course is the second in the microeconomic theory sequence and will focus on the behaviour of 
         decision-makers participating in markets that are not necessarily competitive. Building on the tools developed 
         in Micro I, we first consider cases where firms have market power, or the ability to manipulate market outcomes 
         through oneâ€™s own actions. We will study various imperfectly competitive market structures and show how competition 
         affects consumers, producers and the economy as a whole. This course will introduce new analytical tools in order to 
         study how economic agents can act strategically in order to manipulate market outcomes, which will allow us to 
         have new insights into the effects of economic policy when agents can behave strategically. Finally, this course will 
         discuss competitive markets that are unlikely to achieve efficient resource allocations by introducing the concept of 
         externalities and public goods.</p>
